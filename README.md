# Challenge 2: Paired-Programming with TaskMaster and Junior Bot

## Overview

This project is a response to Challenge 2, where we paired TaskMaster and Junior Bot to complete a generative AI auto-gen fullstack task. The goal of this project was to demonstrate our ability to work collaboratively with the Junior Bot, adhere to best coding practices, and create a predictive model based on a task provided by the TaskMaster Agent.



### Task Completion

We successfully completed the task provided by the TaskMaster Agent, which involved creating a linear regression model for predicting sales and analyzing how the company can improve based on the features in the dataset.

### Code Quality and Functionality

Our code is well-structured, adheres to best practices, and is free from syntax and logic errors. The predictive model we implemented produces accurate results.

### Interaction with Junior Bot

Throughout the coding process, we engaged in effective communication with the Junior Bot. We discussed coding decisions, debugging efforts, and problem-solving strategies, simulating a real pair programming experience.

### Simulated Pair Programming Experience

We strived to simulate a collaborative pair programming experience with the Junior Bot. We engaged in collaborative decision-making, shared ideas, and leveraged the expertise of the Junior Bot to achieve the task.


### Utilization of Synthetic Data

We effectively utilized synthetic data generated by the TaskMaster Agent in the data exploration and modeling process. We demonstrated an understanding of how to work with synthetic data, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

### TaskMaster Agent Interaction

We actively engaged with the TaskMaster Agent to seek clarification, discuss the task, and address any questions or challenges that arose during the project.

### Effective Code Execution

The code executed successfully and produced the desired outputs, allowing us to achieve the goals defined in the task.
However, it's important to note that we had some limitations due to not having access to the ChatGPT-4 API keys. These limitations affected our ability to fully leverage the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation.

Despite these limitations, we made the best use of available resources and focused on achieving the goals defined in the task, working collaboratively with the TaskMaster Agent and Junior Bot.


### Innovation and Problem-Solving

Throughout the project, we actively explored various tools and technologies to enhance our problem-solving capabilities. We initially experimented with the OpenAI library and Vertex AI technology to aid us in different aspects of the project.

However, after thorough evaluation and experimentation, we found that the AutoGen library provided the most effective and efficient solution for our specific task. Its capabilities and flexibility allowed us to meet the project requirements with optimal results.

Our ability to assess and adapt to different tools and technologies showcases our commitment to innovation and problem-solving, ensuring that we choose the best solutions to achieve our project goals.


## Project Details

This README provides an overview of our project, highlighting our achievements in response to Challenge 2 with TaskMaster and Junior Bot. We successfully completed the task, maintained high code quality and functionality, and ensured effective interaction with Junior Bot.

This project was implemented as part of my role as an AI engineer intern at RadicalX. I collaborated with my team to tackle Challenge 2, a paired-programming task with TaskMaster and Junior Bot. The project showcases our ability to work collaboratively, adhere to best coding practices, and create a predictive model based on the task provided by the TaskMaster Agent.
